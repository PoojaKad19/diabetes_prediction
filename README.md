# *** Diabetes Prediction ***<br>
a. The goal of the project was to build a machine learning model to accurately predict patients with diabetes.<br>
b.	Data visualization using pie plot, histogram plot, scatter plot and correlation map, was performed using seaborn and matplotlib packages, tools used in python.<br>
c.	Data was split into 80% training and 20% test sets, and data leakage was avoided between testing and training set.<br>
d.	The Preprocessing steps used for the dataset was scaling the data using standard scaler function in scikit-learn<br>
e.	Best model was selected after training on K-Nearest neighbor, Linear SVM, RBF SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision tree, Random Forest, Gaussian Process, Ada Boost, Muli-Layer perceptron, and QDA<br>
f.	Best accuracy, loss and feature importance were plotted, the SVC performed the best with results of 80.52% and log loss of 0.49. The top 3 features were pregnancy, family history, and BMI<br>
